# TigerStyle: Zig Coding Guidelines

> Distilled from TigerBeetle's production codebase. Safety > Performance > Developer Experience.

## Capability Boundaries

### ✅ Strong Suits
1. Writing high-performance Zig code (Safety > Performance > Developer Experience)
2. Designing Zig data structures and APIs
3. Reviewing Zig code style (assert usage, memory layout, naming conventions)
4. Using comptime assert to verify design integrity

### ⚠️ Requirements
1. User is writing or refactoring Zig code
2. Needs high-performance / production-grade style guidance

### ❌ Out of Scope (with alternatives)
1. Do not use this for standard library API lookup → use zig-0.16 skill instead
2. Do not use this for code review workflow → use zig-code-review skill instead
3. Do not use this for Zig beginner guide → use zig-0.16 skill instead

## When to use

Use this skill when the user is writing, reviewing, or refactoring Zig code, asking about Zig idioms, assertions, memory layout, or API design.

## Data Privacy

This skill does not collect, store, or transmit any user data. All content is derived from the publicly available TigerBeetle codebase style documentation.

# TigerStyle: Zig Coding Guidelines

Distilled from TigerBeetle's [TIGER_STYLE.md](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md).
## Quick Start

**Example invocations:**
```
Review this Zig code with TigerStyle
Design a TigerStyle-compliant Zig struct
What issues does this code have under TigerStyle?
```

## Workflow

Step 1. **Identify needs** — Is the user reviewing, writing, or refactoring?
Step 2. **Load guidelines** — Refer to the Safety/Performance/Naming principles
Step 3. **Check against rules** — Verify against the Pre-Commit Checklist
Step 4. **Output recommendations** — Provide specific fixes per TigerStyle standards

## Design goal priority

**Safety > Performance > Developer Experience**

---

## 1. Safety

### Control Flow
- Use only **simple, explicit control flow**. No recursion unless provably bounded.
- Split compound conditions into nested `if/else` branches — ensure both the positive and negative
  spaces are handled or asserted.
- State invariants positively:

  ```zig
  // preferred
  if (index < length) { ... } else { ... }

  // avoid
  if (index >= length) { ... }
  ```

- Every `if` branch should prompt the question: does a corresponding `else` also need to be handled?

### Assertions
Assertions detect **programmer errors** — not expected runtime errors. The only correct response
to corrupt state is to crash. Assertions downgrade catastrophic correctness bugs into liveness bugs.

- A function must not operate blindly on data it has not checked; assert arguments at the entry point.
- **Pair assertions**: for any property you want to enforce, add assertions on at least two different
  code paths (e.g. just before writing to disk, and immediately after reading back).
- Split compound assertions:

  ```zig
  // preferred
  assert(a);
  assert(b);

  // avoid
  assert(a and b);
  ```

- Use a single-line `if` to assert an implication: `if (a) assert(b);`
- **Assert relationships between compile-time constants** to verify design integrity before the
  program even runs:

  ```zig
  comptime assert(@sizeOf(Header) == 128);
  comptime assert(config.pipeline_max <= config.batch_max);
  ```

- Assert both the **positive space** (what you expect to be true) and the **negative space** (what
  you expect to be false) — the boundary between valid and invalid is where bugs hide.

### Memory
- Initialize large structs **in-place via an out pointer** to eliminate intermediate copies and
  guarantee pointer stability:

  ```zig
  // preferred
  fn init(target: *LargeStruct) !void {
      target.* = .{ ... };
  }

  // avoid
  fn init() !LargeStruct {
      return LargeStruct{ ... };
  }
  ```

### Variable Scope
- Declare variables at the **smallest possible scope** to reduce the chance of misuse.
- Declare variables **close to where they are used** — do not introduce them before they are needed.
  This avoids POCPOU bugs (a distant cousin of TOCTOU).

### Loops and Queues
- All loops and queues must have a **fixed upper bound** to prevent infinite loops or tail-latency
  spikes. Follow the fail-fast principle.
- Loops that genuinely cannot terminate (e.g. an event loop) must be explicitly asserted as such.

### Error Handling
- **All errors must be handled.** Most catastrophic production failures stem from incorrect handling
  of non-fatal errors.
- Never discard error return values with `_`.

### Other
- Use **explicitly-sized integer types** (`u32`, `i64`, etc.), avoid architecture-dependent `usize` when possible
- Enable and respect the **compiler's strictest warning settings** — zero tolerance for warnings.
- Do not react directly to external events inline; let the program run at its own pace (enables
  batching and maintains control-flow ownership).
- **Keep functions as small as possible.** When splitting, find semantically clean cut points:
  - Centralize all `if`/`switch` in the "parent" function; extract pure logic into helpers.
  - Let the parent own all mutable state; helpers compute what to change but don't apply it.
  - Rule of thumb: ["push `if`s up and `for`s down"](https://matklad.github.io/2023/11/15/push-ifs-up-and-fors-down.html).

---

## 2. Performance

- Solve performance in the **design phase** — the biggest wins (1000x) come from architecture,
  not post-hoc profiling.
- Do **back-of-the-envelope sketches** across the four resources (network, disk, memory, CPU) and
  their two characteristics (bandwidth, latency).
- Optimize slowest resources first: network → disk → memory → CPU, weighted by access frequency.
- **Batching** is the primary tool: amortize network, disk, memory, and CPU costs.
- Distinguish **control plane** from **data plane**; batching lets both coexist safely and fast.
- Extract hot-path loops into **standalone functions with primitive arguments** (no `self`) so the
  compiler can cache fields in registers and humans can spot redundant work:

  ```zig
  // hot loop extracted, no self
  fn process_batch(items: []const Item, result: []Output) void { ... }
  ```

- Be explicit. Do not rely on the compiler to do the right thing.
- **Always pass options explicitly** at library call sites — never rely on defaults:

  ```zig
  // preferred
  @prefetch(a, .{ .cache = .data, .rw = .read, .locality = 3 });

  // avoid
  @prefetch(a, .{});
  ```

---

## 3. Naming

- In general, functions are `camelCase`, types are `PascalCase`, variables are `lowercase_with_underscores`.
  One exception to those rules is functions that return types. They are `PascalCase`:
  ```zig
  pub fn ArrayList(comptime T: type) type {
    return ArrayListAligned(T, null);
  }
  ```
- Normally, file names are `lowercase_with_underscore`. However, files that expose a type directly should be `PascalCase`.
- **Do not abbreviate variable names** (except primitive integer loop indices in sorts/matrices).
- Acronyms are fully capitalized: `VSRState`, not `VsrState`.
- **Append units and qualifiers to names**, ordered by descending significance, so the most
  important word comes first:

  ```zig
  latency_ms_max    // not max_latency_ms
  latency_ms_min    // aligns nicely with the above
  message_size_max
  ```

- Choose related names with the **same character count** so they align visually:

  ```zig
  source         // same length as target
  target
  source_offset
  target_offset
  ```

- Name helper/callback functions with the caller's name as a prefix:
  `read_sector()` → `read_sector_callback()`
- **Callbacks go last** in the parameter list (mirrors invocation order).
- Infuse names with meaning: `gpa: Allocator` and `arena: Allocator` are far more informative
  than `allocator: Allocator`.
- Functions that take two or more arguments of the same type must use a named `options: struct` parameter to prevent argument confusion.

### Struct and File Layout

```zig
// Struct order: fields → type definitions → methods
time: Time,
process_id: ProcessID,

const ProcessID = struct { cluster: u128, replica: u8 };
const Tracer = @This();

pub fn init(gpa: std.mem.Allocator, time: Time) !Tracer { ... }
```

- The `main` function goes at the top of the file — readers see the most important thing first.
- Promote complex nested types to top-level structs.

---

## 4. Comments

- Comments are full sentences: space after `//`, capital letter, ending with a period (or colon
  when introducing something). Inline end-of-line comments may be phrases without punctuation.
- **Always say why.** Code shows what and how; comments explain the reasoning behind decisions.
- Add a description at the top of tests explaining the goal and methodology.
- On occasion, use an obviously-true assertion *instead of* a comment to document a critical,
  surprising invariant — the assertion is stronger documentation.

---

## 5. Formatting

- Always run `zig fmt`.
- Use **4 spaces** of indentation (more visually obvious than 2 at a distance).
- **Hard limit of 100 columns per line**, no exceptions. Add a trailing comma and let `zig fmt`
  handle the wrapping.
- **Always add braces to `if` statements** unless the whole thing fits on one line:

  ```zig
  // single-line ok without braces
  if (ok) return;

  // multi-line always needs braces
  if (condition) {
      do_something();
  }
  ```

### Division — be explicit about rounding intent

```zig
@divExact(a, b)   // asserts no remainder
@divFloor(a, b)   // rounds toward negative infinity
div_ceil(a, b)    // rounds toward positive infinity
```

---

## 6. Off-by-One Errors

`index` (0-based), `count` (1-based), and `size` (= count × unit) are **distinct types** with
clear conversion rules:

- `index` → `count`: add 1
- `count` → `size`: multiply by the unit size
- Include units and qualifiers in variable names (see Naming) to make these conversions visible.

---

## 7. Dependencies and Tooling

- **Zero-dependencies policy**: no external dependencies beyond the Zig toolchain.
- Write scripts as `scripts/*.zig` instead of `*.sh` — cross-platform, type-safe, more reliable.
- Standardize on Zig for tooling to reduce dimensionality as the team grows.

## Gotchas

1. **TigerStyle is a high bar** — Designed for production performance-sensitive projects; not every project needs full adherence
2. **Don't overuse assert** — Asserts detect programmer errors, not expected runtime errors
3. **Zero-dependency policy is not universal** — TigerBeetle's policy is specific to its domain
4. **Comptime assert over runtime assert** — Design integrity checks should happen at compile time
5. **Unit suffixes are mandatory** — All fields with units must include a unit suffix (e.g. `_ms`, `_bytes`)

## FAQ

**Q: What is the difference between TigerStyle and official Zig style?**
A: TigerStyle is stricter, adding a hard 100-column limit, 4-space indentation, no recursion, and zero-dependency requirements.

**Q: Must my project fully comply with TigerStyle?**
A: No. TigerStyle is designed for high-frequency trading, databases, and other performance-sensitive domains. Ordinary projects can adopt what fits.

**Q: How does TigerStyle ensure readability?**
A: Through column width limits, naming conventions (significant-first, same-length alignment), and keeping functions small.
