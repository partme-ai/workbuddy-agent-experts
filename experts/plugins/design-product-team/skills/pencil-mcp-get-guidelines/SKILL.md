## When to use this skill

### Intent Recognition (CRITICAL)

**If the answer is NO, do NOT use this skill.**

**CRITICAL PREREQUISITE:**
**You must ONLY use this skill when the user EXPLICITLY mentions "Pencil".**

**ALWAYS use this skill when:**
- You need instructions on **How** to design for a specific system **in Pencil**.
- You are generating code (`topic='code'`).
- You are building a landing page (`topic='landing-page'`).
- You need to know the `.pen` schema details.

**Trigger phrases include:**
- "Get Pencil design guidelines" (获取 Pencil 设计指南)
- "How to use Tailwind in Pencil?" (怎么在 Pencil 里用 Tailwind？)
