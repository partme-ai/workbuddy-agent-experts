# Blender Scene Inspection

Send `scene.inspect` to the active Harness session. Report object names and types, collections,
active camera, frame range, materials, lights, missing assets, warnings, and `sceneRevision`.

Do not use mutating operators during inspection. If Blender changed outside the session, re-inspect
instead of guessing and use the new revision for subsequent commands.
